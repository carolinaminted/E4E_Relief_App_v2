## Token Usage






## Relief Assistant (AI Assistant)
- Open the chat from the floating widget.
- Ask “how do I…” questions about the process.
- The assistant can perform a simple **eligibility check** and explain the result.
- Responses are for guidance of the program.
- Provide information to prefillout application information.
- Context aware of applications and previous submission decisions.

## AI Decisioning and Instant Grant Eligibility

When a user completes the **Apply for Relief** form and clicks **Submit**, the application triggers the **AI Decisioning Service**.  
This service evaluates the applicant’s data against fund-specific eligibility rules and renders a decision in real time.

### Flow Overview
1. **Form Submission**
   - The user’s completed application (contact, event, expenses, acknowledgments) is serialized into a structured payload.
   - This payload includes user metadata and contextual fund information.

2. **AI Eligibility Evaluation**
   - The payload is passed to the AI Decisioning module (`geminiService.ts` or equivalent).
   - The module constructs a structured request aligned with the **eligibility evaluation schema**:
     ```ts
     {
       "tool": "EligibilityEvaluation",
       "input": {
         "fund_id": "<fund-uuid>",
         "country": "US",
         "event_type": "Hurricane",
         "requested_amount": 1200,
         "time_since_event": "5 days",
         "prior_awards": 0
       }
     }
     ```
   - The AI model (e.g., Gemini or GPT) uses fund policy rules and prior case patterns to assess:
     - Applicant eligibility (yes/no + reasoning)
     - Decision type (approve, deny, review)
     - Suggested grant amount (if approved)
     - Policy rationale (text summary for auditing)

3. **Decision Output**
   - The AI returns a structured JSON response:
     ```json
     {
       "eligible": true,
       "decision": "Approved",
       "recommended_award": 1000,
       "reasoning": "Applicant meets criteria and has no prior awards."
     }
     ```
   - The UI displays an instant confirmation banner summarizing the result.
   - The result is logged with the application record for auditing.

4. **Post-Decision Handling**
   - If approved: the app can initiate a **payment creation** record in Dynamics 365 via API.
   - If pending review: it flags the record for manual approval by case workers.
   - If denied: it provides a clear explanation to the applicant, referencing relevant criteria.

### Key Advantages
- **Instant Eligibility Feedback** — applicants know their outcome immediately.
- **Consistent Rule Enforcement** — AI applies the same logic for all applicants.
- **Transparent Reasoning** — every decision carries human-readable justification.
- **Audit Ready** — results are logged for compliance and reporting.


# Integration Overview — Azure AD B2C + Dataverse

## High-Level Plan

1. **Authentication**
   - Use **Azure AD B2C** with **OIDC + PKCE** for secure sign-in and sign-up.
   - Each B2C user is mapped to a **Dataverse Contact** by storing the B2C `oid` (Object ID) on the Contact record.

2. **Backend API Layer**
   - Introduce a **thin backend API** (Azure Function or App Service) as the single integration point between the mobile app and Dataverse.
   - This API validates B2C access tokens, executes business logic, and prevents client-side exposure of secrets.

3. **Token Flow**
   - **Frontend → API**: Authenticated using **B2C access tokens**.
   - **API → Dataverse**: Authenticated using a **Dataverse Application User** (via Azure AD app registration with client credentials).

4. **Data Integration**
   - Replace all mock or local state with **live Dataverse data**:
     - **Contacts** for user profiles.
     - **Applications** for relief submissions.
     - **Awards** for grant outcomes.
   - Use **TanStack Query** to manage cache, sync, and optimistic updates.

5. **AI Decisioning**
   - Run **AI eligibility and grant decisioning** server-side within the API before saving an Application.
   - Store decision outcome, reasoning, and audit trail directly in Dataverse.

6. **Security & Configuration**
   - Store tokens securely in **Keychain/Keystore**.
   - Keep environment variables and API endpoints in a **.env file**.
   - Avoid embedding secrets in mobile code.
   - Enforce **least-privilege roles** and **data access controls** in Dataverse.

7. **Deployment & CI/CD**
   - Implement automated build and release pipelines to:
     - Build and deploy the React Native app.
     - Deploy the API to Azure.
     - Run integration and regression tests against a **UAT Dataverse** environment.

8. **Observability & Reliability**
   - Add **structured logs**, **correlation IDs**, and **error telemetry**.
   - AI decision logs with updates on cases with artifacts used to make the eligibility award or decline decision
   - Provide **user-friendly error messages** for predictable recovery and smoother UX.



## Tips
- This demo does not persist data across refreshes.
- If you see “missing API key,” add your AI key via the environment file.
- Keep your browser tab open during an application session to avoid losing inputs.
